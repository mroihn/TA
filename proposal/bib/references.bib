    abstract  = {The peer review process is a fundamental aspect of modern scientific paper publishing, underpinning essential quality control. First conceptualised in the 1700s, it is an iterative process that aims to elevate scientific literature to the highest standards whilst preventing publication of scientifically unsound, potentially misleading, and even plagiarised information. It is widely accepted that the peer review of scientific papers is an irreplaceable and fundamental aspect of the research process.However, the rapid growth of research and technology has led to a huge increase in the number of publications. This has led to increased pressure on the peer review system. There are several established peer review methodologies, ranging from single and double blind to open and transparent review but their implementation across journals and research fields varies greatly. Some journals are testing entirely novel approaches (such as collaborative reviews), whilst others are piloting changes to established methods. Given the unprecedented growth in publication numbers, and the ensuing burden on journals, editors, and reviewers, it is imperative to improve the quality and efficiency of the peer review process. Herein we evaluate the peer review process, from its historical origins to current practice and future directions.}

    ABSTRACT = {Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that ensures the security and transparency of data, guaranteeing that they cannot be altered. Its application in the peer review of scientific papers can contribute to improving the integrity, transparency, and efficiency of the process, mitigating issues of manipulation and fraud. This work analyzes the contributions of various research studies that address the use of blockchain technology in peer review. The study is a systematic literature review (SLR) in which the PRISMA methodology was applied. Fifty primary studies were identified through searches in databases such as Scopus, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and ACM. The analyzed research reveals innovative approaches, such as decentralized solutions, smart contracts, and token economy, to address challenges like biases, transparency, and speed in the review process. It is concluded that the use of blockchain in peer review processes is still emerging and has not yet been widely adopted globally. However, studies addressing this topic focus on its potential to improve transparency and trust in the process, offer incentives and rewards to reviewers and authors, enhance the quality and fairness of evaluations, and strengthen the security and privacy of the data involved.},

    abstract = {This history column article provides a tour of the main software development life cycle (SDLC) models. (A lifecycle covers all the stages of software from its inception with requirements definition through to fielding and maintenance.) System development lifecycle models have drawn heavily on software and so the two terms can be used interchangeably in terms of SDLC, especially since software development in this respect encompasses software systems development. Because the merits of selecting and using an SDLC vary according to the environment in which software is developed as well as its application, I discuss three broad categories for consideration when analyzing the relative merits of SDLC models. I consider the waterfall model before the other models because it has had a profound effect on software development, and has additionally influenced many SDLC models prevalent today. Thereafter, I consider some of the mainstream models and finish with a discussion of what the future could hold for SDLC models.},
